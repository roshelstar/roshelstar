ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @roshelstar, a beginner coder who's passionate about learning new programming languages and building cool projects.

ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in web development, mobile app development, and game development. I'm also interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I'm working on building my first web application. I'm also exploring different frameworks and libraries like React and Node.js.

ðŸ’ž I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects and connect with other developers who are passionate about coding. I'm excited to learn from others and contribute to the community.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on GitHub. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
